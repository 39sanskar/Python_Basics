##List is Mutable.
myListOne = [1,2,3]
myListTwo = myListOne
##print(myListOne)

myListOne = "chai"
print(myListTwo)
##in the above code myListOne is assign the reference velue in the memory that is [1, 2, 3].
## in myListTwo it assign myListOne that has the acctual value in the memory which is [1, 2, 3].
# print(myListTwo) that will be print [1, 2, 3].
# update myListOne = "chai". that myListOne refer the value which is "chai".
# Hence the conclusion  in myListTwo that refer the value of mylistOne which is [1,2,3]. not 
#not the value "chai" bec of that it assign the value not the variable.
